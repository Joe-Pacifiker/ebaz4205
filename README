This GitHub Repository is used for FPGA Development with the EBAZ4205.

(1) Vivado 2020.1 will be used in conjunction with Ubuntu 18.04.1
(2) Custom board files are borrowed from another github repository ...
(3) Early projects will only focus on the PL (Programmable Logic)
(4) Projects will demonstrate mastery of communication protocols

Once a firm understanding is acquired for this development board larger SoC related projects will be carried out with this board. This will be used as a foundation for strengthening both VHDL and Verilog HDL skills since the EBAZ4205 PL can interpret both HDL languages.

This file will be updated during the course of project's lifecycle.
