This GitHub Repository is used for FPGA Development with the EBAZ4205.

(1) Vivado 2020.1 will be used in conjunction with Ubuntu 18.04.1
(2) Custom board files are borrowed from another github repository ...
(3) Early projects will only focus on the PL (Programmable Logic)
(4) Projects will demonstrate mastery of communication protocols

Once a firm understanding is acquired for this development board larger SoC related projects will be carried out with this board. 
This will be used as a foundation for strengthening both VHDL and Verilog HDL skills since the EBAZ4205 PL can interpret both HDL languages.

This file will be updated during the course of project's lifecycle.

| Project 0: Power Up |

This project describes how to provide power to the EBAZ4205.
This is just one of many ways to do it (I view it as the easy less expensive vay).
There are three Data pin sections for the EBAZ4205, and each one has a power and ground pin that can be used to power the entire board.
There needs to be a 1 amp current provided to power up this board. (I found this information through a link I will provide in a later update to this project)


| Project 1: Setup |

This project focuses on the setup of the Vivado Synthesis tool with regards to the EBAZ4205 FPGA Development Board.
The EBAZ4205 FPGA is a custom development board, meaning it is not provided in Vivado's known list of FPGA board files.
So this FPGA needs custom board files to be provided to Vivado in order for the EBAZ4205 to have HDL projects uploaded to it.
For this project the Vivado 2020.1 version will be used for this purpose.

The custom board files consist of the following:
board.xml - How the EBAZ4205 internal chips and components communicate with one another.
preset.xml - The preset file for the custom board
part0_pins.xml - How parts are configured with pins
ebaz4205.jpg - Picture of the FPGA Development board

When these files are created and located in '<tools>/Xilinx/Vivado/2020.1/data/boards/board_files/ebaz4205/1.0/*', Vivado
 successfully recognizes the custom board in the New Project Wizard.

If the custom board is not showing up in the New Project Wizard then you can use the 'validate_board_files' tcl command
 in the Vivado GUI. Make sure though to include the proper <!DOCTYPE ... > just below the <?xml /> tag to be able to see
 the xml error messages.

This Project will be returned to later to explore this feature with other versions of the Vivado Synthesis tool.

| Project 2: AND2 |

This project will try to recreate the example project found on the internet for a simple AND gate.
